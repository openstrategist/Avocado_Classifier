# Basic Avocado Classifier

 - Using Keras (over tensorflow) to test image classification over ripe and non-ripe avocados.
 - Adding Apples and Collection of Apple images to classify when the object is not an avocado.
 - Dataset collected from Kaggle (Fruit 360 Dataset)
 - CNN Code based on mcbean's fruit-classification-w-nn and shivamb's cnn-architectures-vgg-resnet-inception-tl

## Future Goals
 - Detect categories of avocado ripeness.
 - Detect avocado in a normal image or a box bounded zoomed in image.

## How to run?
Execute "python main.py"

### Modifications
 - Change input/test, input/training and input/validation files to train your NN differently.
